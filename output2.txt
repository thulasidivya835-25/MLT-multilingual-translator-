The (und) great (__en) auk (und) displayed (und) in (__en) the (und) Natural (und) History (und) Museum (und) of (__en) Denmark (__en) stand’s (und) erect (und) on (__en) its (__en) pedestal, (und) its (__en) great (__en) beak (__en) jutting (und) forward, (__en) apparently (__en) fearless. (__en) It (und) is (__en) possessed (und) of (__en) a (und) certain (und) dignity (und) and (__en) grace. (und) It (und) demands (und) my (__en) attention. (__en) It (und) was (__en) probably (__en) killed (__en) off (__en) Iceland, (__en) where (__en) I (__en) come (__it) from, (__en) and (__en) was (__en) one (__en) of (__en) the (und) last (und) of (__en) its (__en) kind. (und) For (und) thousands (__en) of (__en) years, (__en) this (__en) large, (__en) flightless (und) bird (und) swam (und) the (und) extensive (und) waters (und) of (__en) the (und) North (__en) Atlantic (und) and (__en) made (__en) its (__en) nests (__en) on (__en) islands (und) and (__en) skerries, (und) where (__en) each (__en) pair (und) laid (__en) and (__en) incubated (__en) a (und) single, (und) uniquely (und) patterned (__en) egg (und) per (__it) year. (__en) According (__en) to (__en) most (__en) accounts, (__en) the (und) last (und) of (__en) the (und) great (__en) auks (und) (Pinguinus (und) impennis) (und) were (__en) slaughtered (__en) on (__en) Eldey, (und) an (und) island (und) off (__en) Iceland’s (und) southwest (__en) coast, (__en) in (__en) June (__en) 1844. (und) About (und) eighty (und) taxidermic (und) examples (und) of (__en) great (__en) auks (und) exist (und) in (__en) museum (und) collections, (und) and (__en) most (__en) of (__en) them (__en) came (__en) from (__en) Eldey. (__en) English (__en) Hola, (und) ¿cómo (__es) estás? (und) Alongside (und) the (und) great (__en) auk (und) displayed (und) in (__en) Copenhagen (und) are (__en) four (__en) large (__en) glass (und) jar’s. (und) One (und) is (__en) labeled: (und) Iceland (__en) 1844, (und) ♂. (und) These (__en) jars (und) contain (und) the (und) viscera (und) of (__en) great (__en) auks (und) killed (__en) on (__en) that (__en) famous (__en) (or (__en) infamous) (und) expedition (__en) to (__en) Eldey.

(und) These (__en) are (__en) not (und) all (und) the (und) birds’ (und) organs; (__en) some (__en) are (__en) stored (und) in (__en) another (__en) seven (__en) jars (und) elsewhere (und) in (__en) the (und) museum, (__en) out (und) of (__en) the (und) public (__en) eye, (__en) along (__en) with (__en) another (__en) stuffed (__en) great (__en) auk; (und) at (__en) my (__en) request, (und) a (und) museum (und) guide (und) takes (__en) me (und) to (__en) see (__en) this (__en) second (__en) bird. (__en) It (und) is (__en) posed (__en) somewhat (__en) differently (__en) than (__en) the (und) one (__en) on (__en) display. (und) Its (__en) beak (__en) is (__en) open, (__en) as (__en) if (und) ready (und) to (__en) address (__en) the (und) visitor. (und) Unlike (und) the (und) first (__en) bird’s (und) stark (und) black (und) white (und) plumage, (und) this (__en) one (__en) looks (__en) grayish (__en) Быстрая (__ru) and (__en) rather (__en) dull. (und) I (__en) am (und) told (__en) it (__en) is (__en) a (und) true (und) rarity; (__en) it (__en) is (__en) in (__en) winter (und) plumage, (und) while (und) most (__en) great (__en) auks (und) were (__en) captured (__en) when (und) breeding, (und) in (__en) early (__en) summer.1 (und) Perhaps (__en) this (__en) second (__en) bird (und) was (__en) कू (und) दता (__hi) caged (__en) alive (und) and (__en) slaughtered (__en) in (__en) winter. (und) Perhaps (__en) it (__en) was (__en) kept (__en) as (__en) a (und) pet (und) for (__en) some (__en) months, (und) like (__en) a (und) great (__en) auk (und) owned (__en) by (__en) the (und) Danish (__en) polymath (und) Ole (und) Worm (und) (1588– (und) 1654), (__es) one (__en) of (__en) the (und) leading (__en) figures (und) of (__en) the (und) Renaissance (und) in (__en) the (und) Nordic (und) world.
